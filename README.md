# Robotic Automation

**In progress project in creating an autonomous robotic platform**. 

This repository serve as creative ground for personal ideas and experiments on **robot kinematics**, **computer vision application**, and **AI intgeration** for robotic systems. 

The platform consist of an open-source 3D printed robotic arm designed by BCN3D: _The Moveo_.

- BCN3D Moveo has 5 Degrees of Freedom cotrolled using and Arduino Mega 5 stepper motor drivers. The specifications and part files can be found in this repository, additionally the original project is referenced below. 
- A robust control platform will also be added using ROS instead of traditional G-code.

## To Do
- complete assembly documentation for BCN3D moveo
- formulate an inverse kinematic model
- create motion tracking model to map 2D visual input to 3D motor output
- train object detection and recognition for common household items

## Future Tasks
- Pick-and-sort: recognising different objects and move them corresponding to their labels.
